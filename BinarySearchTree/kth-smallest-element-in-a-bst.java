What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? 
How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?

Insert and delete in a BST were discussed last week, the time complexity of these operations is O(H)\mathcal{O}(H)O(H), 
where HHH is a height of binary tree, and H=log‚Å°NH = \log NH=logN for the balanced tree.

Hence without any optimisation insert/delete + search of kth element has O(2H+k)\mathcal{O}(2H + k)O(2H+k) complexity. 
How to optimise that?

That's a design question, basically we're asked to implement a structure which contains a BST inside and optimises the 
following operations :

    Insert

    Delete

    Find kth smallest

Seems like a database description, isn't it? Let's use here the same logic as for LRU cache design, and combine an
indexing structure (we could keep BST here) with a double linked list.

Such a structure would provide:

    O(H)\mathcal{O}(H)O(H) time for the insert and delete.

    O(k)\mathcal{O}(k)O(k) for the search of kth smallest.
