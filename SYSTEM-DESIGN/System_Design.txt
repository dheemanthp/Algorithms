System Design : The main aspects of System Design , High Level Design
You may have to cover Low level design : Interfaces and classes and their interaction , inheritence and polymorphism


1) Scalability: Performance loss vs Cost
2) Reliability : Redundancy is a key aspect to ensure reliability but comes at a cost
3) Availability : Percentage of time a system remains operational
4) Efficiency: Response time , throughput
5) Mangebility : Ease of operation, maintainence , ease of diagnostics ,ease of updates
6) Vulnerability & security : Identify Security Risks
7) Concurrency :

Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling: 
Horizontal scaling means that you scale by adding more servers into your pool of resources
Example: Cassandra and MongoDB

whereas Vertical scaling means that you scale by adding more power 
(CPU, RAM, Storage, etc.) to an existing server.
Example:Mysql
=============================================================================================
Load Balancer (LB) is another critical component of any distributed system. 
It helps to spread the traffic across a cluster of servers to improve responsiveness 
and availability of applications, websites or databases
We can have load balancers at multiple stages , but tyically before Edge server

Advantages:
1)Users experience faster, uninterrupted service
2)handle incoming requests while decreasing wait time for users.
3)Smart load balancers provide benefits like predictive analytics that determine traffic bottlenecks before they happen
4)System administrators experience fewer failed or stressed components.
Instead of a single device performing a lot of work, load balancing has several devices perform a little bit of work.
5)Health Checks - Load balancers perform health checks , and should only forward traffic to “healthy” backend servers.

In Load Balancers we can have redundancy i,.e we can have backup for the load balancers too
We may call one Load balancer as active , and may be another as passive

Caching
CDNs(Content Data Network) are a kind of cache that comes into play for sites serving large amounts of static media.
In a typical CDN setup, a request will first ask the CDN for a piece of static media; 
the CDN will serve that content if it has it locally available. If it isn’t available,
the CDN will query the back-end servers for the file, cache it locally, and serve it to the requesting user.

While caching is fantastic, it does require some maintenance for keeping "cache coherent"
with the source of truth (e.g., database). If the data is modified in the database, 
it should be invalidated in the cache; if not, this can cause inconsistent application behavior.

Cache eviction policies
Following are some of the most common cache eviction policies:

    First In First Out (FIFO): The cache evicts the first block accessed first
    without any regard to how often or how many times it was accessed before.
    Last In First Out (LIFO): The cache evicts the block accessed most recently
    first without any regard to how often or how many times it was accessed before.
    Least Recently Used (LRU): Discards the least recently used items first.
    Most Recently Used (MRU): Discards, in contrast to LRU, the most recently used items first.
    Least Frequently Used (LFU): Counts how often an item is needed.
    Those that are used least often are discarded first.
    Random Replacement (RR): Randomly selects a candidate item and discards it to make space when necessary.

=============================================================================================
Data partitioning
Data partitioning is a technique to break up a big database (DB) into many smaller parts. 
It is the process of splitting up a DB/table across multiple machines to improve the manageability, 
performance, availability, and load balancing of an application. The justification for data partitioning is that,
after a certain scale point, it is cheaper and more feasible to scale horizontally 
by adding more machines than to grow it vertically by adding beefier servers.



a. Horizontal partitioning: In this scheme, we put different rows into different tables.
Horizontal partitioning is also called as "Data Sharding".
The key problem with this approach is that if the value whose range is used for partitioning
 isn’t chosen carefully, then the partitioning scheme will lead to unbalanced servers.

b. Vertical Partitioning: In this scheme, we divide our data to store tables related 
to a specific feature in their own server. All related Data remain in the same server.
Vertical partitioning is straightforward to implement and has a low impact on the application

 Directory Based Partitioning: A loosely coupled approach to work around issues mentioned 
in the above schemes is to create a lookup service which knows your current partitioning scheme
 and abstracts it away from the DB access code.This loosely coupled approach means we can perform tasks
like adding servers to the DB pool or changing our partitioning scheme without having an impact on the application.

Partitioning Criteria

a. Key or Hash-based partitioning: Under this scheme, we apply a hash function to some key attributes 
of the entity we are storing; that yields the partition number. For example, if we have 100 DB servers 
and our ID is a numeric value that gets incremented by one each time a new record is inserted

b. List partitioning: In this scheme, each partition is assigned a list of values, so whenever we want to
insert a new record, we will see which partition contains our key and then store it there. 
For example, we can decide all users living in Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, or Denmark 
will be stored in a partition for the Nordic countries.

c. Round-robin partitioning: This is a very simple strategy that ensures uniform data distribution. 
With ‘n’ partitions, the ‘i’ tuple is assigned to partition (i mod n).

d. Composite partitioning: Under this scheme, we combine any of the above partitioning schemes to
devise a new scheme. For example, first applying a list partitioning scheme and then a hash based partitioning.
Consistent hashing could be considered a composite of hash and list partitioning where the hash 
reduces the key space to a size that can be listed.

Common Problems of Data Partitioning
a. Joins and Denormalization: once a database is partitioned and spread across multiple machines 
it is often not feasible to perform joins that span database partitions.
Such joins will not be performance efficient since data has to be compiled from multiple servers.
 A common workaround for this problem is to denormalize the database so that queries that previously 
required joins can be performed from a single table. Of course, the service now has to deal with all the
 perils of denormalization such as data inconsistency.

b. Referential integrity: As we saw that performing a cross-partition query on a partitioned database is not
feasible, similarly, trying to enforce data integrity constraints such as foreign keys in a partitioned database can be extremely difficult.
https://database.guide/what-is-referential-integrity/

c. Rebalancing: There could be many reasons we have to change our partitioning scheme:

    The data distribution is not uniform, e.g., there are a lot of places for a particular ZIP code that cannot fit into one database partition.
    There is a lot of load on a partition, e.g., there are too many requests being handled by the DB partition dedicated to user photos.
=============================================================================================
Indexing:
Indexes are well known when it comes to databases. Sooner or later there comes a time when database performance
is no longer satisfactory. One of the very first things you should turn to when that happens is database indexing.

The goal of creating an index on a particular table in a database is to make it faster to search through the
table and find the row or rows that we want. Indexes can be created using one
or more columns of a database table, providing the basis for both rapid random lookups and efficient access of ordered records.

=============================================================================================
Proxies:
A proxy server is an intermediate server between the client and the back-end server.
 Clients connect to proxy servers to make a request for a service like a web page, file, connection, etc.
 In short, a proxy server is a piece of software or hardware that acts as an intermediary 
for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers.

Advantages:
1) proxies are used to filter requests, log requests, or sometimes transform requests 
(by adding/removing headers, encrypting/decrypting, or compressing a resource). 
2) If multiple clients access a particular resource, the proxy server can cache it 
and serve it to all the clients without going to the remote server.

Proxies can reside on the client’s local server or anywhere between the client and the remote servers. 
Here are a few famous types of proxy servers:
a)Open Proxy
An open proxy is a proxy server that is accessible by any Internet user.
b)Reverse Proxy
A reverse proxy retrieves resources on behalf of a client from one or more servers. 
These resources are then returned to the client, appearing as if they originated from the proxy server itself

=============================================================================================
Redundancy and Replication:

Redundancy is the duplication of critical components or functions of a system with the intention of
increasing the reliability of the system, usually in the form of a backup or fail-safe, or to
improve actual system performance. For example, if there is only one copy of a file stored on a single server,
then losing that server means losing the file. Since losing data is seldom a good thing,
we can create duplicate or redundant copies of the file to solve this problem.

Replication means sharing information to ensure consistency between redundant resources,
such as software or hardware components, to improve reliability, fault-tolerance, or accessibility.

=============================================================================================
Following are the most common types of NoSQL:

Key-Value Stores: Data is stored in an array of key-value pairs. 
The ‘key’ is an attribute name which is linked to a ‘value’. Well-known key-value stores include Redis, Voldemort, and Dynamo.

Document Databases: In these databases, data is stored in documents (instead of rows and columns in a table)
and these documents are grouped together in collections. Each document can have an entirely different structure.
Document databases include the CouchDB and MongoDB.

Wide-Column Databases: Instead of ‘tables,’ in columnar databases we have column families,
which are containers for rows. Unlike relational databases, we don’t need to know all the columns up
front and each row doesn’t have to have the same number of columns. Columnar databases are best suited for 
analyzing large datasets - big names include Cassandra and HBase.

Graph Databases: These databases are used to store data whose relations are best represented in a graph.
Data is saved in graph structures with nodes (entities), properties (information about the entities),
and lines (connections between the entities). Examples of graph database include Neo4J and InfiniteGraph.

Querying: SQL databases use SQL (structured query language) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful.
 In a NoSQL database, queries are focused on a collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called UnQL (Unstructured Query Language).
 Different databases have different syntax for using UnQL.

Scalability: In most common situations, SQL databases are vertically scalable,
i.e., by increasing the horsepower (higher Memory, CPU, etc.) of the hardware, which can get very expensive.
It is possible to scale a relational database across multiple servers, but this is a challenging and time-consuming process.

On the other hand, NoSQL databases are "horizontally scalable", meaning we can add more servers easily 
in our NoSQL database infrastructure to handle a lot of traffic. Any cheap commodity hardware or cloud
instances can host NoSQL databases, thus making it a lot more cost-effective than vertical scaling.
A lot of NoSQL technologies also distribute data across servers automatically.

SQL VS. NoSQL - Which one to use?

When it comes to database technology, there’s no one-size-fits-all solution. 
That’s why many businesses rely on both relational and non-relational databases for different needs.
 Even as NoSQL databases are gaining popularity for their speed and scalability,
 there are still situations where a highly structured SQL database may perform better;
 choosing the right technology hinges on the use case.

Reasons to use SQL database
ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability) 
https://searchsqlserver.techtarget.com/definition/ACID
Here are a few reasons to choose a SQL database:

We need to ensure ACID compliance. ACID compliance reduces anomalies and protects the integrity
of your database by prescribing exactly how transactions interact with the database. 
Generally, NoSQL databases sacrifice ACID compliance for scalability and processing speed, 
but for many e-commerce and financial applications, an ACID-compliant database remains the preferred option.

Your data is structured and unchanging. If your business is not experiencing massive growth 
that would require more servers and if you’re only working with data that is consistent,
then there may be no reason to use a system designed to support a variety of data types and high traffic volume.

Reasons to use NoSQL database
1) Storing large volumes of data that often have little to no structure. 
2) Making the most of cloud computing and storage.Cloud-based storage is an excellent cost-saving solution
 but requires data to be easily spread across multiple servers to scale up.
3)Rapid development. NoSQL is extremely useful for rapid development as it doesn’t need to be prepped ahead of time.
