System Design : The main aspects of System Design , High Level Design
You may have to cover Low level design : Interfaces and classes and their interaction , inheritence and polymorphism


1) Scalability: Performance loss vs Cost
2) Reliability : Redundancy is a key aspect to ensure reliability but comes at a cost
3) Availability : Percentage of time a system remains operational
4) Efficiency: Response time , throughput
5) Mangebility : Ease of operation, maintainence , ease of diagnostics ,ease of updates
6) Vulnerability & security : Identify Security Risks
7) Concurrency : 

Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling: 
Horizontal scaling means that you scale by adding more servers into your pool of resources
Example: Cassandra and MongoDB

whereas Vertical scaling means that you scale by adding more power 
(CPU, RAM, Storage, etc.) to an existing server.
Example:Mysql
